## Project Description
Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s!
Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:

- The number of rooms
- The distance to employment centres
- How rich or poor the area is
- How many students there are per teacher in local schools

To accomplish your task you will:

1. Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
2. Split the data for training and testing
3. Run a Multivariable Regression
4. Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals
5. Use data transformation to improve your model performance
6. Use your model to estimate a property price
